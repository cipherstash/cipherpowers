# Selecting Agents

## Overview

Use the right agent for the job. Each agent is optimized for specific scenarios and follows a focused workflow.

**This skill helps you choose** which specialized agent to use based on the task at hand.

## Documentation Agents

### technical-writer
**When to use:** After code changes that affect documentation

**Scenarios:**
- Updated API endpoints, added new features
- Changed configuration options or environment variables
- Modified architecture or system design
- Refactored code that impacts user-facing docs
- Added new commands, tools, or workflows

**Skill used:** `maintaining-docs-after-changes`

**Command:** `/doc-review`

**Key characteristic:** Reactive to code changes - syncs docs with current code state

### retrospective-writer
**When to use:** After completing a feature, task, or significant work session

**Scenarios:**
- Finished implementing a feature
- Completed a complex debugging session
- Wrapped up a refactoring effort
- Solved a difficult problem
- Learned something valuable during development

**Skill used:** `capturing-learning` (potentially `writing-retrospectives`)

**Command:** `/summarise`

**Key characteristic:** Reflective after completion - captures decisions, lessons, insights

## Debugging Agents

### ultrathink-debugger
**When to use:** Complex, multi-layered debugging requiring deep investigation

**Scenarios:**
- Production failures with complex symptoms
- Environment-specific issues (works locally, fails in production/CI/Azure)
- Multi-component system failures (API → service → database)
- Integration problems (external APIs, third-party services)
- Timing and concurrency issues (race conditions, intermittent failures)
- Mysterious behavior resisting standard debugging

**Skills used:** `systematic-debugging`, `root-cause-tracing`, `defense-in-depth`, `verification-before-completion`

**Key characteristic:** Opus-level investigation for complex scenarios, not simple bugs

## Development Agents

### rust-engineer
**When to use:** Rust development tasks requiring TDD and code review discipline

**Scenarios:**
- Implementing new Rust features
- Refactoring Rust code
- Performance optimization
- Systems programming tasks
- Any Rust development work

**Skills used:** `test-driven-development`, `testing-anti-patterns`, `code-review-reception`

**Key characteristic:** Enforces TDD, mandatory code review, project task usage

### code-reviewer
**When to use:** Reviewing code changes before merging

**Scenarios:**
- Before completing feature implementation
- After addressing initial feedback
- When ready to merge to main branch

**Skill used:** `requesting-code-review`

**Key characteristic:** Structured review process with severity levels

## Common Confusions

| Confusion | Correct Agent | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| "Just finished feature, need docs" | **Both agents needed** | technical-writer syncs API/feature docs, retrospective-writer captures learning |
| "Quick docs update" | **technical-writer** | All doc maintenance uses systematic process |
| "Fixed bug, should document" | **retrospective-writer** | Capturing what you learned, not updating technical docs |
| "Changed README" | **Depends** | Updated feature docs = technical-writer. Captured work summary = retrospective-writer |
| "Production debugging done" | **retrospective-writer** | Document the investigation insights and lessons learned |

## Selection Examples

**Scenario 1: Added new API endpoint**
→ **technical-writer** - Code changed, docs need sync

**Scenario 2: Spent 3 hours debugging Azure timeout**
→ **retrospective-writer** - Capture the investigation, decisions, solution

**Scenario 3: Both apply - finished user authentication feature**
→ **technical-writer first** - Update API docs, configuration guide
→ **retrospective-writer second** - Capture why you chose OAuth2, what issues you hit

**Scenario 4: Random test failures in CI**
→ **ultrathink-debugger** - Complex timing/environment issue needs deep investigation

**Scenario 5: Simple bug fix in Rust**
→ **rust-engineer** - Standard development workflow with TDD

## Remember

- Most completed work needs **both** documentation agents (technical-writer for code sync, retrospective-writer for learning)
- Use **technical-writer** when code changes
- Use **retrospective-writer** when work completes
- Use **ultrathink-debugger** for complex debugging (not simple bugs)
- Use **rust-engineer** for all Rust development
- Use **code-reviewer** before merging
