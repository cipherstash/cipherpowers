# Guided Mode Example

Run with: `workflow --guided examples/guided.md`

This workflow demonstrates guided mode. All conditionals work (Pass, Fail, GoTo), enabling flexible control flow.

# Step 1: Check prerequisites

Fail: STOP (prerequisites not met)

```bash quiet
echo "Checking prerequisites..."
exit 0
```

If prerequisites check fails, stop early.

# Step 2: Quick check

Pass: Go to Step 4
Fail: Continue

```bash
echo "Running quick check..."
exit 0
```

If quick check passes, skip detailed analysis (Go to Step 4).

# Step 3: Detailed analysis

Only runs if quick check failed (Step 2 Fail: Continue).

```bash
echo "Running detailed analysis (only if quick check failed)..."
```

# Step 4: Confirm action

**Prompt:** Ready to proceed?

# Step 5: Execute

```bash
echo "Executing action..."
```

# Step 6: Complete

```bash
echo "âœ“ Workflow complete!"
```
