# Summarise

Create a retrospective summary of completed work, capturing decisions, lessons learned, and insights.

## Instructions

Activate the capturing-learning skill to guide the retrospective:

```
Skill(skill: "cipherpowers:capturing-learning")
```

The skill provides:
- **Step 1**: Review the work (git diff, changes made)
- **Step 2**: Capture learning (decisions, approaches, issues, time)
- **Step 3**: Save and link (to .work/ directory or CLAUDE.md)

**Key Principle:** Exhaustion after completion is when capture matters most. The harder the work, the more valuable the lessons.
