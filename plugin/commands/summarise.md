# Summarise

Create a comprehensive retrospective summary of completed work, capturing decisions, lessons learned, and insights for continuous improvement.

<instructions>
## Instructions

1. **Follow the learning capture skill:**
   - Read: `@skills/documentation/capturing-learning/SKILL.md`
   - This skill contains the complete retrospective workflow:
     - Step 1: Review the work (identify location, review changes)
     - Step 2: Capture learning (decisions, approaches, issues, time)
     - Step 3: Save and link (to work directory or CLAUDE.md)
     - Step 4: Merge if existing summary

2. **The skill references project documentation standards:**
   - `@plugin/docs/practices/documentation.md` - Summary format and standards

**Key Principle:**
Exhaustion after completion is when capture matters most. The harder the work, the more valuable the lessons.

**Why this structure?**
- Skill = Universal workflow (learning capture process)
- Practices = Project-specific standards (summary format)
- Command = Thin dispatcher (integrates with work tracking)
