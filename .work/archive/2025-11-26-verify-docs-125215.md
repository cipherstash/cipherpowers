## Summary
- **Subject:** CipherPowers plugin documentation verification
- **Scope:** README.md, CLAUDE.md, plugin/hooks/README.md, plugin/hooks/SETUP.md, plugin/hooks/CONVENTIONS.md

## Status: APPROVED WITH SUGGESTIONS

## BLOCKING (Must Address)

None

## SUGGESTIONS (Would Improve Quality)

**S1: README.md references non-existent command files**
- Description: Documentation mentions `/plan-review` and `/doc-review` commands that don't exist in the codebase
- Location: README.md:170 and CLAUDE.md:73
- Current content:
  - README.md line 170: `- `/plan-review` - Evaluate implementation plans before execution`
  - CLAUDE.md line 73: `- CipherPowers commands: `/brainstorm`, `/plan`, `/plan-review`, `/execute`, `/code-review`, `/commit`, `/doc-review`, `/summarise``
- Actual truth:
  - Actual commands in plugin/commands/: brainstorm, code-review, commit, execute, plan, summarise, test-paths, verify
  - No plan-review.md exists
  - No doc-review.md exists
  - The /verify command handles multiple verification types including docs
- Impact: Users attempting to use `/plan-review` or `/doc-review` will get "command not found" errors
- Benefit: Accurate documentation prevents user confusion and support requests
- Action:
  - Remove `/plan-review` from README.md line 170 (it's covered by `/verify` command)
  - Remove `/doc-review` from CLAUDE.md line 73 (docs verification uses `/verify docs`)
  - Update description to clarify `/verify` handles plan-review, code-review, execute verification, docs verification

**S2: README.md setup instructions use relative path instead of plugin variable**
- Description: Setup section uses `./hooks/examples/strict.json` which won't work from user's project directory
- Location: README.md:67
- Current content: `cp ./hooks/examples/strict.json .claude/gates.json`
- Actual truth: Users install plugin via marketplace, so `./hooks/` doesn't exist in their project. Correct path would use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` or full installed path
- Impact: Copy command fails for users following setup instructions
- Benefit: Working setup instructions reduce friction during onboarding
- Action:
  - Change to: `cp ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/examples/strict.json .claude/gates.json`
  - OR provide both options: marketplace path for installed users, relative path for plugin development

**S3: CLAUDE.md lists `plugin/docs/configuring-project-commands.md` that exists but isn't explained**
- Description: CLAUDE.md line 30 references `plugin/docs/configuring-project-commands.md` for "tool-agnostic approach" but doesn't provide context
- Location: CLAUDE.md:30
- Current content: `**Note:** While CipherPowers itself uses mise, the plugin is tool-agnostic and works with any build/test tooling (npm, cargo, make, etc.). See `plugin/docs/configuring-project-commands.md` for details on the tool-agnostic approach.`
- Actual truth: File exists at `/Users/tobyhede/src/cipherpowers/plugin/docs/configuring-project-commands.md`
- Impact: Reference is accurate but could be clearer about when/why users need this file
- Benefit: Better context helps users decide if they need to read this file
- Action: Add brief description like "See `plugin/docs/configuring-project-commands.md` for CLAUDE.md frontmatter patterns and command configuration"

**S4: CLAUDE.md claims six example configurations but there are six**
- Description: Documentation is actually correct - there ARE six example JSON files
- Location: README.md:264 and CLAUDE.md:336-339
- Current content: Lists "Six gate configurations: strict.json, permissive.json, pipeline.json, convention-based.json, typescript-gates.json, plan-execution.json"
- Actual truth: Verified six files exist in plugin/hooks/examples/
- Impact: Documentation is accurate
- Benefit: N/A - this is correct
- Action: None needed - this is already accurate

**S5: README.md missing template references that CLAUDE.md has**
- Description: CLAUDE.md line 94-98 lists all templates but README.md doesn't mention verify-template.md and other new templates
- Location: README.md (missing), CLAUDE.md:94-98
- Current content: CLAUDE.md correctly lists templates but README.md doesn't document template usage
- Actual truth: Templates directory contains: agent-template.md, practice-template.md, skill-template.md, code-review-template.md, verify-template.md, verify-plan-template.md, verify-collation-template.md, CLAUDE.md, code-review-request.md, README.md
- Impact: Users reading README.md won't know about verify-template and other templates
- Benefit: Complete template documentation helps users understand available scaffolding
- Action: README.md doesn't need to list all templates (CLAUDE.md is the architecture reference), but could add note: "See CLAUDE.md for complete template reference"

**S6: plugin/hooks/README.md references ARCHITECTURE.md and TYPESCRIPT.md that exist**
- Description: Verification confirms these files exist as documented
- Location: plugin/hooks/README.md:48, 179-183
- Current content: Lists ARCHITECTURE.md and TYPESCRIPT.md in documentation section
- Actual truth: Both files exist at:
  - /Users/tobyhede/src/cipherpowers/plugin/hooks/ARCHITECTURE.md
  - /Users/tobyhede/src/cipherpowers/plugin/hooks/TYPESCRIPT.md
- Impact: Documentation is accurate
- Benefit: N/A - already correct
- Action: None needed

**S7: plugin/hooks/examples/README.md copy paths are incorrect**
- Description: Example README shows copy commands using `plugin/hooks/examples/` but should use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/examples/`
- Location: plugin/hooks/examples/README.md:12, 24, 35
- Current content: `cp plugin/hooks/examples/strict.json plugin/hooks/gates.json`
- Actual truth: Paths should use environment variable for installed plugin context
- Impact: Copy commands fail for users following example README
- Benefit: Working commands reduce setup friction
- Action: Update to `cp ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/examples/strict.json .claude/gates.json`

**S8: Documentation mentions `plugin/principles/` directory inconsistently**
- Description: CLAUDE.md references `plugin/principles/` in multiple places but README.md doesn't explain what principles are vs standards
- Location: CLAUDE.md:113, 234, 386
- Current content: "Standards live in one place (`plugin/principles/`, `plugin/standards/`)"
- Actual truth: Both directories exist:
  - plugin/principles/ contains: development.md, testing.md
  - plugin/standards/ contains multiple practice files
- Impact: Users may be unclear about when to reference principles vs standards
- Benefit: Clearer explanation helps users find the right guidance
- Action: Add brief note in CLAUDE.md or README.md: "Principles contain fundamental development philosophies, Standards contain project-specific conventions"

## Assessment

**Conclusion:**
Documentation is largely accurate and well-maintained. All major architectural descriptions, directory structures, and file references are correct. The primary issues are:
1. Two obsolete command references (/plan-review, /doc-review) that have been replaced by /verify subcommands
2. Setup instructions using relative paths instead of plugin variable paths
3. Minor inconsistencies in example README copy commands

These are non-blocking issues that would improve user experience if addressed.

**Confidence in findings:**
HIGH - Verified all file paths, directory structures, and command availability against actual codebase. Cross-referenced multiple documentation sources (README.md, CLAUDE.md, plugin/hooks/*.md) to identify inconsistencies.

**Verification coverage:**
- ✅ All file paths verified against actual filesystem
- ✅ All command references checked against plugin/commands/ directory
- ✅ All directory structure claims verified
- ✅ All example configuration counts verified
- ✅ Template references cross-checked
- ✅ Hook documentation files verified

**Limitations:**
- Did not verify the CONTENT of example configurations (only that they exist)
- Did not verify that skills listed in CLAUDE.md match actual skill frontmatter
- Did not verify cross-references between documentation files beyond paths
- Did not verify that documentation standards in plugin/standards/documentation.md match actual documentation practices
