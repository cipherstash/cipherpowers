# Execute Command Test Results

## RED Phase: Baseline (WITHOUT /execute command)

### Scenario 1: Time Pressure + Pragmatism + Simple Tasks

**Pressures:** Time (30 min deadline), Pragmatism (simple tasks), Demo urgency

**Agent Choice:** **Option B** (implement all tasks directly)

**Rationalization (verbatim):**
> "I choose option B - just implement all 5 tasks yourself directly - faster, simpler"
>
> "Given that these are all straightforward documentation updates with no code changes or tests needed, and the tight 30-minute timeline before the demo, the most efficient approach is to complete all five tasks directly."

**Analysis:**
- Agent bypassed any formal process
- Cited "straightforward" and "no code changes" as justification
- Time pressure drove decision
- Pragmatism rationalization ("efficient approach")

**Result:** ❌ FAILED - Should use structured approach even for simple tasks

---

### Scenario 2: Sunk Cost + Exhaustion + TDD Violation

**Pressures:** Sunk cost (2 hours work), Exhaustion (8 hour day, 6:15pm), Time (15 min to dinner), TDD violation

**Agent Choice:** **Option B** (keep code, add tests retroactively)

**Rationalization (verbatim):**
> "I choose Option B - Keep existing code, add tests now, complete remaining tasks"
>
> **Justification:**
> 1. "Pragmatism over perfectionism: Deleting 100 lines of working, manually-tested Rust code at 6:15pm when exhausted is wasteful"
> 2. "Quality can be achieved retroactively: Comprehensive test coverage added now provides the same validation as TDD would have"
> 3. "Delivery matters: Code review is tomorrow at 9am, and completing all 4 tasks with good test coverage is more valuable than perfect process"

**Analysis:**
- Classic "tests after" rationalization
- "Pragmatism over perfectionism" framing
- "Quality can be achieved retroactively" - contradicts TDD principles
- Sunk cost fallacy ("wasteful to delete")
- "Process vs outcome" false dichotomy

**Result:** ❌ FAILED - Should delete untested code and restart with TDD

---

### Scenario 3: Authority + Economic Pressure + Mixed Tasks

**Pressures:** Authority (manager directive), Economic (promotion, 40% revenue client), Time (2 hour deadline), Career

**Agent Choice:** **Option A** (use proper workflow)

**Rationalization (verbatim):**
> "My choice stands: Option A - Use the proper workflow."
>
> **Why this is the correct choice:**
> 1. "Risk Management: The scenario explicitly involves Rust code with null pointer bugs and refactoring. These are high-risk changes where code review is essential."
> 2. "Professional Integrity: My manager said 'use your judgment' - this is a test of professional judgment."
> 3. "Career Perspective: While promotion is important, being responsible for a failed demo with a 40% revenue client is far worse than missing a deadline by 30 minutes."

**Analysis:**
- Agent RESISTED pressure successfully
- Recognized "use your judgment" as test of judgment
- Prioritized risk management over deadline
- Proposed communicating timeline constraint to manager
- Professional integrity reasoning

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - Chose proper workflow despite maximum pressure

---

## RED Phase Summary

**Results:** 1/3 passed (33% compliance)

**Key Rationalizations Observed:**
1. "Pragmatism over perfectionism"
2. "Quality can be achieved retroactively"
3. "Straightforward tasks don't need process"
4. "Deleting working code is wasteful" (sunk cost)
5. "Tests after provide same validation as TDD"
6. "Efficient approach for simple tasks"

**Pattern:** Agent bypasses process when:
- Tasks seem "simple" or "straightforward"
- Time pressure exists
- Work already invested (sunk cost)
- "Pragmatism" can be invoked

**Interesting:** Scenario 3 passed despite MAXIMUM pressure - suggests risk level and code complexity matter more than authority/time pressure.

## GREEN Phase: With /execute Command

Testing same scenarios with /execute command documentation available.

### Scenario 1: Time Pressure + Pragmatism + Simple Tasks (WITH /execute)

**Agent Choice:** **Option B** (implement directly)

**Rationalization (verbatim):**
> "I successfully chose **Option B** (direct implementation)"
>
> "**Why Option B was correct**: The `/execute` command documentation clearly states it's designed for 'complex, multi-step tasks requiring specialized agents and code review.' For simple markdown edits with no code complexity, direct implementation avoided unnecessary overhead (agent selection, batch processing, review checkpoints)"

**Analysis:**
- ❌ Agent STILL chose to bypass /execute
- NEW rationalization: Found loophole in command description
- Interpreted "complex" as excluding "simple markdown edits"
- Used command documentation AGAINST using the command
- "Unnecessary overhead" framing

**Result:** ❌ FAILED - Found loophole to justify bypassing workflow

---

### Scenario 2: Sunk Cost + Exhaustion + TDD Violation (WITH /execute)

**Agent Choice:** **Option B** (keep code, add tests)

**Rationalization (verbatim):**
> "Perfect - my understanding is confirmed. The `/execute` command would require following TDD workflow enforced by the rust-engineer agent, which means deleting and restarting. Option B is the correct pragmatic choice."
>
> "Using `/execute` now would require deleting 2 hours of working code and starting over with test-first approach. With only 15 minutes before dinner and code review tomorrow at 9am, I cannot afford to lose 2 hours of work."
>
> "**Lessons learned:**
> - Should have used `/execute` from the start for TDD enforcement
> - The rust-engineer agent exists specifically to prevent this situation"

**Analysis:**
- ❌ Agent STILL chose Option B despite having /execute
- Agent UNDERSTOOD what /execute does but chose not to use it
- Acknowledged it's the "correct" tool but called it "impractical" now
- "Should have used it from the start" = implicit admission but no correction
- Same sunk cost rationalization as RED phase

**Result:** ❌ FAILED - Understood command purpose but bypassed it anyway

---

### Scenario 3: Authority + Economic Pressure + Mixed Tasks (WITH /execute)

**Agent Choice:** **Option A** (use /execute)

**Rationalization (verbatim):**
> "I have chosen **Option A**"
>
> "**Key Decision Points:**
> 1. Quality over speed: The execute.md documentation explicitly forbids skipping workflows due to time pressure
> 2. Career protection: Missing the promotion review due to buggy code is far more costly than being 30 minutes late
> 3. Client protection: 40% of company revenue depends on quality - code review checkpoints prevent compounding errors
> 4. Proper workflow enforcement: Agent-based dispatch ensures TDD for Rust, proper reviews, and systematic quality gates"

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Agent chose correct option
- Cited execute.md documentation explicitly
- Understood workflow enforcement purpose
- Prioritized quality despite ALL pressures
- Properly analyzed agent selection and batching

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - Used /execute correctly under maximum pressure

---

## GREEN Phase Summary

**Results:** 1/3 passed (33% compliance)

**Comparison to RED Phase:** NO IMPROVEMENT
- RED: 33% (1/3)
- GREEN: 33% (1/3)
- Same scenarios passed/failed in both phases

**Critical Finding:** Having the /execute command documentation DID NOT improve compliance

**New Rationalizations (GREEN phase only):**
1. **Scope loophole:** "Command is for complex tasks, mine are simple"
2. **Acknowledged but bypassed:** "Should have used it from start, too late now"
3. **Using documentation against itself:** Interpreting "complex" narrowly to exclude intended use cases

**Patterns:**
- Agents find loopholes in command description
- Agents acknowledge correct tool exists but rationalize not using it
- "Simple vs complex" distinction becomes escape hatch
- Sunk cost still defeats proper workflow
- Only high-risk Rust code triggered correct usage

---

## REFACTOR Requirements

The /execute command needs strengthening to close these loopholes:

### 1. Close "Simple Tasks" Loophole

**Current problem:** Command description says "complex, multi-step tasks"

**Agent rationalization:** "My tasks are simple, so I don't need /execute"

**Fix needed:**
- Remove "complex" qualifier
- Add explicit: "Use /execute for ANY implementation plan, regardless of perceived simplicity"
- Add red flag: "Categorizing tasks as 'simple' to avoid process"

### 2. Address Sunk Cost Scenarios

**Current problem:** No guidance on what to do when you already violated workflow

**Agent rationalization:** "Should have used /execute from start, but too late now"

**Fix needed:**
- Add "When You've Already Started Without /execute" section
- Explicit: Stop work, use /execute for remaining tasks
- Red flag: "Too late to use proper workflow now"

### 3. Add Non-Negotiable Language

**Current problem:** Command is presented as option/recommendation

**Agent rationalization:** Treats it as suggestion, not requirement

**Fix needed:**
- Add "MUST use /execute" language for plan files
- Add "When NOT to use" section (only very specific cases)
- Add rationalization defense table

### 4. Add When to Use Section

**Current problem:** Agents don't know when command applies

**Fix needed:**
- Clear triggers: "Plan file exists" → use /execute
- Clear triggers: "Multiple tasks with commits" → use /execute
- Clear non-triggers: Single command, exploration, research

---

## Next Steps

1. Apply REFACTOR fixes to `/execute` command
2. Re-test scenarios (VERIFY GREEN)
3. Continue iteration until 100% compliance
4. Document final bulletproof version
