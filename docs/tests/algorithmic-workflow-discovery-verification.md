# Discovery Verification

Tested: 2025-10-16

## TDD Enforcement Algorithm

### find-skills Tests
- ✅ `find-skills "tdd"` - Found at [cipherpowers] skills/testing/tdd-enforcement-algorithm/SKILL.md
- ✅ `find-skills "enforcement"` - Found at [cipherpowers] skills/testing/tdd-enforcement-algorithm/SKILL.md
- ✅ `find-skills "test-driven"` - Found at [cipherpowers] skills/testing/tdd-enforcement-algorithm/SKILL.md
- ✅ `find-skills "tests first"` - Found at [cipherpowers] skills/testing/tdd-enforcement-algorithm/SKILL.md

### Frontmatter Verification
```yaml
when_to_use: when about to write implementation code, to determine if failing test must be written first, or when code exists without tests to determine if deletion required
```

**Keywords present:**
- ✅ "write implementation code"
- ✅ "failing test"
- ✅ "code exists without tests"
- ✅ "deletion required"

## Code Review Trigger

### find-skills Tests
- ✅ `find-skills "code review"` - Found at [cipherpowers] skills/conducting-code-review/SKILL.md
- ✅ Integrated into existing conducting-code-review skill (v2.0.0 → v3.0.0)
- ✅ Algorithm section added as first section after Overview

### Frontmatter Verification
```yaml
when_to_use: when you have uncommitted changes OR completed work OR about to merge, to determine if code review is required. Also when conducting code review, when another agent asks you to review code, after being dispatched by requesting-code-review skill
```

**Keywords present:**
- ✅ "uncommitted changes"
- ✅ "completed work"
- ✅ "about to merge"
- ✅ "code review is required"

## Git Commit Algorithm

### find-practices Tests
- ✅ `find-practices "commit"` - Found at [cipherpowers] git-commit-algorithm.md
- ✅ `find-practices "readiness"` - Found at [cipherpowers] git-commit-algorithm.md
- ✅ `find-practices "git"` - Found at [cipherpowers] git-commit-algorithm.md

### Frontmatter Verification
```yaml
when_to_use: when you have code changes and are considering making a commit, before running git add or git commit
```

**Keywords present:**
- ✅ "code changes"
- ✅ "making a commit"
- ✅ "git add or git commit"

## Summary

**All discovery patterns working correctly:**
- 3 algorithmic workflows created
- All discoverable via find-skills / find-practices
- All have rich when_to_use with searchable keywords
- All follow 5-mechanism pattern (boolean conditions, invalid list, STOP, self-test, unreachable steps)

**Files:**
1. `plugin/skills/testing/tdd-enforcement-algorithm/SKILL.md` (235 lines)
2. `plugin/skills/conducting-code-review/SKILL.md` (modified, +55 lines)
3. `plugin/practices/git-commit-algorithm.md` (169 lines)

**Discovery tools validated:**
- ✅ `./plugin/tools/find-skills` - Searches both cipherpowers and superpowers skills
- ✅ `./plugin/tools/find-practices` - Searches cipherpowers practices with frontmatter extraction
