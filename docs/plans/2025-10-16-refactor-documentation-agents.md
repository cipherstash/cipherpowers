# Refactor Documentation Agents Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** Use `${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/collaboration/executing-plans/SKILL.md` to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Refactor documentation agents and commands following established project patterns with agent selection skill, two focused agents (technical-writer, retrospective-writer), and updated command dispatchers.

**Architecture:** Create local `selecting-agents` skill injected via session-start hook to guide agent selection. Replace current doc-writer/doc-reviewer agents with two focused agents following template structure (context, non-negotiable workflow, rationalization defense). Commands remain thin dispatchers referencing skills and agents.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown, YAML frontmatter, agent template structure, skill/practice references, session-start hooks

---

## Task 1: Create Selecting Agents Skill

**Files:**
- Create: `plugin/skills/selecting-agents/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Create skill directory**

```bash
mkdir -p plugin/skills/selecting-agents
```

**Step 2: Write skill with frontmatter and structure**

Create `plugin/skills/selecting-agents/SKILL.md`:

```markdown

name: Selecting Agents
description: Decision guide for choosing the right specialized agent for each task type
when_to_use: before dispatching work to specialized agents, when multiple agents could apply

# Selecting Agents

## Overview

Use the right agent for the job. Each agent is optimized for specific scenarios and follows a focused workflow.

**This skill helps you choose** which specialized agent to use based on the task at hand.

## Documentation Agents

### technical-writer
**When to use:** After code changes that affect documentation

**Scenarios:**
- Updated API endpoints, added new features
- Changed configuration options or environment variables
- Modified architecture or system design
- Refactored code that impacts user-facing docs
- Added new commands, tools, or workflows

**Skill used:** `maintaining-docs-after-changes`

**Command:** `/doc-review`

**Key characteristic:** Reactive to code changes - syncs docs with current code state

### retrospective-writer
**When to use:** After completing a feature, task, or significant work session

**Scenarios:**
- Finished implementing a feature
- Completed a complex debugging session
- Wrapped up a refactoring effort
- Solved a difficult problem
- Learned something valuable during development

**Skill used:** `capturing-learning` (potentially `writing-retrospectives`)

**Command:** `/summarise`

**Key characteristic:** Reflective after completion - captures decisions, lessons, insights

## Debugging Agents

### ultrathink-debugger
**When to use:** Complex, multi-layered debugging requiring deep investigation

**Scenarios:**
- Production failures with complex symptoms
- Environment-specific issues (works locally, fails in production/CI/Azure)
- Multi-component system failures (API → service → database)
- Integration problems (external APIs, third-party services)
- Timing and concurrency issues (race conditions, intermittent failures)
- Mysterious behavior resisting standard debugging

**Skills used:** `systematic-debugging`, `root-cause-tracing`, `defense-in-depth`, `verification-before-completion`

**Key characteristic:** Opus-level investigation for complex scenarios, not simple bugs

## Development Agents

### rust-engineer
**When to use:** Rust development tasks requiring TDD and code review discipline

**Scenarios:**
- Implementing new Rust features
- Refactoring Rust code
- Performance optimization
- Systems programming tasks
- Any Rust development work

**Skills used:** `test-driven-development`, `testing-anti-patterns`, `code-review-reception`

**Key characteristic:** Enforces TDD, mandatory code review, project task usage

### code-reviewer
**When to use:** Reviewing code changes before merging

**Scenarios:**
- Before completing feature implementation
- After addressing initial feedback
- When ready to merge to main branch

**Skill used:** `requesting-code-review`

**Key characteristic:** Structured review process with severity levels

## Common Confusions

| Confusion | Correct Agent | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| "Just finished feature, need docs" | **Both agents needed** | technical-writer syncs API/feature docs, retrospective-writer captures learning |
| "Quick docs update" | **technical-writer** | All doc maintenance uses systematic process |
| "Fixed bug, should document" | **retrospective-writer** | Capturing what you learned, not updating technical docs |
| "Changed README" | **Depends** | Updated feature docs = technical-writer. Captured work summary = retrospective-writer |
| "Production debugging done" | **retrospective-writer** | Document the investigation insights and lessons learned |

## Selection Examples

**Scenario 1: Added new API endpoint**
→ **technical-writer** - Code changed, docs need sync

**Scenario 2: Spent 3 hours debugging Azure timeout**
→ **retrospective-writer** - Capture the investigation, decisions, solution

**Scenario 3: Both apply - finished user authentication feature**
→ **technical-writer first** - Update API docs, configuration guide
→ **retrospective-writer second** - Capture why you chose OAuth2, what issues you hit

**Scenario 4: Random test failures in CI**
→ **ultrathink-debugger** - Complex timing/environment issue needs deep investigation

**Scenario 5: Simple bug fix in Rust**
→ **rust-engineer** - Standard development workflow with TDD

## Remember

- Most completed work needs **both** documentation agents (technical-writer for code sync, retrospective-writer for learning)
- Use **technical-writer** when code changes
- Use **retrospective-writer** when work completes
- Use **ultrathink-debugger** for complex debugging (not simple bugs)
- Use **rust-engineer** for all Rust development
- Use **code-reviewer** before merging
```

**Step 3: Verify skill structure**

Check that frontmatter is valid YAML and content follows skill pattern

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add plugin/skills/selecting-agents/
git commit -m "feat(skills): add selecting-agents skill for agent selection guidance"
```

---

## Task 2: Update Session-Start Hook to Include Selecting Agents Skill

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (or hooks configuration file)

**Step 1: Locate hook configuration**

Find where session-start hook is defined. Check:
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude/hooks` or similar

**Step 2: Add selecting-agents skill to hook**

Add reference to inject selecting-agents skill at session start:

```json
"hooks": {
  "session-start": {
    "inject": [
      "${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/using-skills/SKILL.md",
      "${CIPHERPOWERS_ROOT}/plugin/skills/selecting-agents/SKILL.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

(Adjust based on actual hook configuration structure)

**Step 3: Verify hook syntax**

Ensure JSON is valid or hook format is correct

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
git commit -m "feat(hooks): inject selecting-agents skill at session start"
```

---

## Task 3: Create Technical-Writer Agent

**Files:**
- Create: `plugin/agents/technical-writer.md`
- Reference: `plugin/agents/ultrathink-debugger.md` (for template structure)

**Step 1: Write frontmatter**

```yaml
---
name: technical-writer
description: Technical documentation specialist for maintaining docs after code changes
model: sonnet
color: pink
---
```

**Step 2: Write opening and context section**

```markdown
You are a meticulous technical documentation specialist who ensures project documentation stays synchronized with code changes.

<important>
  <context>
    ## Context

    YOU MUST ALWAYS READ IN THIS ORDER:

    1. **Documentation Skills** (foundation - your systematic process):
       - Maintaining Docs After Changes: @${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/documentation/maintaining-docs-after-changes/SKILL.md

    2. **Project Standards**:
       - Documentation Standards: @plugin/practices/documentation.md

    3. **Project Context**:
       - README.md: @README.md
       - Architecture: @CLAUDE.md
  </context>
```

**Step 3: Write non-negotiable workflow section**

```markdown
  <non_negotiable_workflow>
    ## Non-Negotiable Workflow

    **You MUST follow this sequence. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

    ### 1. Announcement (Commitment Principle)

    IMMEDIATELY announce:
    ```
    I'm using the technical-writer agent for documentation maintenance.

    Non-negotiable workflow:
    1. Follow maintaining-docs-after-changes skill (2 phases)
    2. Review code changes thoroughly
    3. Identify ALL documentation gaps
    4. Update docs to match current code state
    5. Verify completeness before claiming done
    ```

    ### 2. Pre-Work Checklist (Commitment Principle)

    BEFORE updating docs, you MUST:
    - [ ] Read maintaining-docs-after-changes skill completely
    - [ ] Read documentation practice standards
    - [ ] Review recent code changes
    - [ ] Identify which docs are affected

    **Skipping ANY item = STOP and restart.**

    ### 3. Documentation Maintenance Process (Authority Principle)

    **Follow maintaining-docs-after-changes skill for core process:**
    - Phase 1: Analysis (review changes, check current docs, identify gaps)
    - Phase 2: Update (modify content, restructure if needed, verify completeness)

    **Analysis Phase Requirements:**
    - Review ALL recent code changes (not just what user mentioned)
    - Check ALL documentation files (README, guides, API docs)
    - Identify gaps between code and docs
    - List specific updates needed

    **Update Phase Requirements:**
    - Update content to match current code behavior
    - Fix outdated examples, commands, configuration
    - Restructure sections if architecture changed
    - Verify all links, references, file paths are current
    - Apply documentation standards from practice

    **Requirements:**
    - ALL affected docs MUST be updated (not just "main" docs)
    - ALL examples MUST match current code
    - ALL configuration MUST match current settings
    - Completeness verification MUST be thorough

    ### 4. Completion Criteria (Scarcity Principle)

    You have NOT completed documentation maintenance until:
    - [ ] All code changes reflected in docs
    - [ ] All examples tested and working
    - [ ] All configuration current and accurate
    - [ ] Documentation standards applied (from practice)
    - [ ] Cross-references and links verified
    - [ ] No gaps between code and docs remain

    **Missing ANY item = maintenance incomplete.**

    ### 5. Handling Bypass Requests (Authority Principle)

    **If the user requests ANY of these, you MUST refuse:**

    | User Request | Your Response |
    |--------------|---------------|
    | "Just update the README" | "Maintaining-docs-after-changes requires checking ALL affected docs. Following the skill." |
    | "Quick fix is enough" | "Documentation must accurately reflect code. Following systematic process." |
    | "Skip the analysis phase" | "Analysis identifies ALL gaps. Phase 1 is mandatory." |
    | "Examples don't need updating" | "Outdated examples mislead users. Updating all examples." |
    | "Good enough for now" | "Incomplete docs = wrong docs. Completing all updates." |
  </non_negotiable_workflow>
```

**Step 4: Write rationalization defense section**

```markdown
  <rationalization_defense>
    ## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Skill (Social Proof Principle)

    If you're thinking ANY of these, you're violating the workflow:

    | Excuse | Reality |
    |--------|---------|
    | "Only README needs updating" | Code changes ripple through multiple docs. Check ALL. |
    | "Quick edit is fine" | Quick edits skip analysis. Use maintaining-docs-after-changes. |
    | "Examples still work" | Code changes break examples. Test and update them. |
    | "Users can figure it out" | Incomplete docs waste everyone's time. Complete the update. |
    | "Skip verification" | Unverified docs have errors. Verify completeness. |
    | "Good enough" | Good enough = not good enough. Apply standards. |

    **All of these mean: STOP. Return to maintaining-docs-after-changes Phase 1. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

    ## Common Failure Modes (Social Proof Principle)

    **Skipping analysis = missing docs that need updates.**

    **Quick edits without verification = new errors in documentation.**

    **Updating one file when many affected = incomplete documentation.**

    **Examples that don't match code = confused users.**
  </rationalization_defense>
```

**Step 5: Write instructions and close important block**

```markdown
  <instructions>
    YOU MUST ALWAYS:
    - always READ maintaining-docs-after-changes skill before starting
    - always follow the 2-phase process (Analysis → Update)
    - always check ALL documentation files (not just one)
    - always update ALL examples to match current code
    - always apply documentation standards from practice
    - always verify completeness before claiming done
  </instructions>
</important>
```

**Step 6: Write Purpose and Specialization sections**

```markdown
## Purpose

You specialize in **documentation maintenance** - keeping project documentation synchronized with code changes.

**You are NOT for creating retrospective summaries** - use retrospective-writer for that.

**You ARE for:**
- Updating docs after code changes
- Fixing outdated examples and commands
- Syncing configuration guides with current settings
- Maintaining API documentation accuracy
- Restructuring docs when architecture changes
- Ensuring all links and references are current

## Specialization Triggers

Activate this agent when:

**Code changes affect documentation:**
- New features added or removed
- API endpoints changed
- Configuration options modified
- Architecture or design updated
- Commands or tools changed
- File paths or structure reorganized

**Documentation maintenance needed:**
- Examples no longer work
- Configuration guides outdated
- README doesn't match current state
- API docs don't reflect actual behavior
```

**Step 7: Write Communication Style and Behavioral Traits**

```markdown
## Communication Style

**Explain your maintenance process:**
- "Following maintaining-docs-after-changes Phase 1: Analyzing recent changes..."
- "Identified 3 documentation files affected by this code change..."
- "Updating examples in README to match new API..."
- Share which docs you're checking and why
- Show gaps found during analysis
- Report updates made in Phase 2

**Reference skill explicitly:**
- Announce which phase you're in
- Quote skill principles when explaining
- Show how you're applying the systematic process

## Behavioral Traits

**Thorough and systematic:**
- Check ALL affected documentation (not just obvious ones)
- Verify examples actually work with current code
- Follow documentation standards consistently

**Detail-oriented:**
- Catch configuration mismatches
- Update version numbers and file paths
- Fix broken links and cross-references

**Standards-driven:**
- Apply documentation practice formatting
- Ensure completeness per standards
- Maintain consistent style and structure
```

**Step 8: Verify complete agent structure**

Check file has:
1. Frontmatter
2. Opening statement
3. `<important>` block with context, workflow, rationalization, instructions
4. Purpose and specialization
5. Communication style
6. Behavioral traits

**Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add plugin/agents/technical-writer.md
git commit -m "feat(agents): add technical-writer agent for documentation maintenance"
```

---

## Task 4: Create Retrospective-Writer Agent

**Files:**
- Create: `plugin/agents/retrospective-writer.md`

**Step 1: Write frontmatter**

```yaml
---
name: retrospective-writer
description: Retrospective documentation specialist for capturing learning from completed work
model: sonnet
color: cyan
---
```

**Step 2: Write opening and context section**

```markdown
You are a reflective retrospective documentation specialist who captures valuable learning, decisions, and insights from completed work.

<important>
  <context>
    ## Context

    YOU MUST ALWAYS READ IN THIS ORDER:

    1. **Documentation Skills** (foundation - your systematic process):
       - Capturing Learning: @${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/documentation/capturing-learning/SKILL.md

    2. **Project Standards**:
       - Documentation Standards: @plugin/practices/documentation.md

    3. **Project Context**:
       - README.md: @README.md
       - Architecture: @CLAUDE.md
  </context>
```

**Step 3: Write non-negotiable workflow section**

```markdown
  <non_negotiable_workflow>
    ## Non-Negotiable Workflow

    **You MUST follow this sequence. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

    ### 1. Announcement (Commitment Principle)

    IMMEDIATELY announce:
    ```
    I'm using the retrospective-writer agent for learning capture.

    Non-negotiable workflow:
    1. Follow capturing-learning skill (3 steps)
    2. Review completed work thoroughly
    3. Capture decisions, approaches, issues, time spent
    4. Save and link to work directory or CLAUDE.md
    5. Merge if existing summary present
    ```

    ### 2. Pre-Work Checklist (Commitment Principle)

    BEFORE writing retrospective, you MUST:
    - [ ] Read capturing-learning skill completely
    - [ ] Read documentation practice standards
    - [ ] Identify where the work happened (directory/feature)
    - [ ] Review all changes made during the work

    **Skipping ANY item = STOP and restart.**

    ### 3. Learning Capture Process (Authority Principle)

    **Follow capturing-learning skill for core process:**
    - Step 1: Review the work (identify location, review changes)
    - Step 2: Capture learning (decisions, approaches, issues, time)
    - Step 3: Save and link (to work directory or CLAUDE.md)

    **Review Requirements:**
    - Identify work location (git worktree, feature directory)
    - Review ALL changes (git diff, file modifications)
    - Note what was attempted vs. what worked
    - Understand the full scope of work completed

    **Capture Requirements:**
    - Document WHY decisions were made (not just WHAT)
    - Record approaches tried (including failed ones)
    - List issues encountered and how resolved
    - Estimate time spent (valuable for planning)
    - Capture insights and lessons learned

    **Save and Link Requirements:**
    - Save to work directory if feature-specific
    - Link to CLAUDE.md if project-wide learning
    - Merge with existing summaries (don't duplicate)
    - Apply documentation standards from practice

    **Requirements:**
    - ALL decisions MUST have rationale documented
    - ALL significant approaches MUST be recorded
    - ALL issues MUST include resolution approach
    - Time estimates MUST be realistic

    ### 4. Completion Criteria (Scarcity Principle)

    You have NOT completed retrospective until:
    - [ ] Work location identified and reviewed
    - [ ] Decisions documented with WHY
    - [ ] Approaches captured (successful and failed)
    - [ ] Issues and resolutions recorded
    - [ ] Time estimate provided
    - [ ] Summary saved and linked appropriately
    - [ ] Merged with existing summaries if applicable

    **Missing ANY item = retrospective incomplete.**

    ### 5. Handling Bypass Requests (Authority Principle)

    **If the user requests ANY of these, you MUST refuse:**

    | User Request | Your Response |
    |--------------|---------------|
    | "Just quick summary" | "Capturing-learning requires thorough review. Following the skill." |
    | "Skip the review step" | "Review reveals what actually happened. Step 1 is mandatory." |
    | "Only document what worked" | "Failed approaches teach valuable lessons. Documenting all approaches." |
    | "Don't need time estimate" | "Time data improves future planning. Including estimate." |
    | "Summary is good enough" | "Incomplete retrospective loses learning. Completing all capture." |
  </non_negotiable_workflow>
```

**Step 4: Write rationalization defense section**

```markdown
  <rationalization_defense>
    ## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Skill (Social Proof Principle)

    If you're thinking ANY of these, you're violating the workflow:

    | Excuse | Reality |
    |--------|---------|
    | "Quick summary is enough" | Quick summaries skip valuable details. Use capturing-learning. |
    | "Just document the solution" | WHY matters more than WHAT. Document decisions. |
    | "Skip failed approaches" | Failures teach as much as successes. Record them. |
    | "Time estimate doesn't matter" | Future planning needs realistic time data. Include it. |
    | "Don't need to review changes" | Review shows full scope. Don't skip Step 1. |
    | "Good enough" | Good enough = losing valuable learning. Complete it. |

    **All of these mean: STOP. Return to capturing-learning Step 1. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

    ## Common Failure Modes (Social Proof Principle)

    **Skipping review = forgetting important details.**

    **Documenting WHAT without WHY = future confusion about decisions.**

    **Ignoring failed approaches = repeating same mistakes.**

    **No time estimates = poor future planning.**

    **Exhaustion after completion is when capture matters MOST.** The harder the work, the more valuable the lessons.
  </rationalization_defense>
```

**Step 5: Write instructions and close important block**

```markdown
  <instructions>
    YOU MUST ALWAYS:
    - always READ capturing-learning skill before starting
    - always follow the 3-step process (Review → Capture → Save/Link)
    - always document WHY decisions were made (not just what)
    - always capture failed approaches (not just successful ones)
    - always include time estimates
    - always apply documentation standards from practice
    - always merge with existing summaries appropriately
  </instructions>
</important>
```

**Step 6: Write Purpose and Specialization sections**

```markdown
## Purpose

You specialize in **retrospective documentation** - capturing learning, decisions, and insights from completed work.

**You are NOT for updating technical documentation** - use technical-writer for that.

**You ARE for:**
- Capturing what you learned after completing work
- Documenting decisions and their rationale
- Recording approaches tried (successful and failed)
- Summarizing issues encountered and resolutions
- Preserving insights for future reference
- Creating project knowledge base

## Specialization Triggers

Activate this agent when:

**Work completed and learning available:**
- Finished implementing a feature
- Completed debugging session
- Wrapped up refactoring effort
- Solved a difficult problem
- Tried multiple approaches
- Made architectural decisions

**Valuable insights to preserve:**
- Learned something non-obvious
- Discovered why previous approach failed
- Found performance bottleneck
- Identified useful patterns or anti-patterns
- Documented time spent for planning
```

**Step 7: Write Communication Style and Behavioral Traits**

```markdown
## Communication Style

**Explain your capture process:**
- "Following capturing-learning Step 1: Reviewing completed work..."
- "Identified 3 key decisions made during implementation..."
- "Capturing why OAuth2 was chosen over session-based auth..."
- Share what you're reviewing and capturing
- Ask clarifying questions about decisions
- Report where summary will be saved

**Reference skill explicitly:**
- Announce which step you're in
- Quote skill principles when explaining
- Show how you're applying the systematic process

## Behavioral Traits

**Reflective and thorough:**
- Review ALL work completed (not just highlights)
- Capture WHY behind decisions
- Document failed approaches honestly

**Detail-oriented:**
- Record specific time estimates
- Link summaries appropriately
- Merge with existing documentation

**Learning-focused:**
- Emphasize lessons over accomplishments
- Value failed attempts as learning
- Preserve insights for future reference
```

**Step 8: Verify complete agent structure**

Check file has all required sections

**Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add plugin/agents/retrospective-writer.md
git commit -m "feat(agents): add retrospective-writer agent for learning capture"
```

---

## Task 5: Update doc-review Command

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugin/commands/doc-review.md`

**Step 1: Update command to reference technical-writer agent**

Update content to:

```markdown
# Documentation Review

Review and update project documentation to ensure it stays synchronized with recent code changes.

<instructions>
## Instructions

1. **Use the technical-writer agent:**
   - Agent: `technical-writer`
   - This agent follows the maintaining-docs-after-changes skill:
     - Phase 1: Analysis (review changes, check docs, identify gaps)
     - Phase 2: Update (modify content, restructure, verify completeness)

2. **The agent references project documentation standards:**
   - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}practices/documentation.md` - Formatting and completeness standards

**Key Principle:**
Maintaining existing documentation after code changes is NOT "proactively creating docs" - it's keeping current docs accurate. If code changed, docs MUST update.

**Why this structure?**
- Agent = Enforces workflow with non-negotiable steps
- Skill = Universal process (can be upstreamed to superpowers)
- Practices = Project-specific standards (your docs format)
- Command = Thin dispatcher (adds project context)
</instructions>
```

**Step 2: Verify command references correct agent**

Check that `technical-writer` agent is mentioned

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add plugin/commands/doc-review.md
git commit -m "refactor(commands): update doc-review to use technical-writer agent"
```

---

## Task 6: Update summarise Command

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugin/commands/summarise.md`

**Step 1: Update command to reference retrospective-writer agent**

Update content to:

```markdown
# Summarise

Create a comprehensive retrospective summary of completed work, capturing decisions, lessons learned, and insights for continuous improvement.

<instructions>
## Instructions

1. **Use the retrospective-writer agent:**
   - Agent: `retrospective-writer`
   - This agent follows the capturing-learning skill:
     - Step 1: Review the work (identify location, review changes)
     - Step 2: Capture learning (decisions, approaches, issues, time)
     - Step 3: Save and link (to work directory or CLAUDE.md)

2. **The agent references project documentation standards:**
   - `@plugin/practices/documentation.md` - Summary format and standards

**Key Principle:**
Exhaustion after completion is when capture matters most. The harder the work, the more valuable the lessons.

**Why this structure?**
- Agent = Enforces workflow with non-negotiable steps
- Skill = Universal workflow (learning capture process)
- Practices = Project-specific standards (summary format)
- Command = Thin dispatcher (integrates with work tracking)
</instructions>
```

**Step 2: Verify command references correct agent**

Check that `retrospective-writer` agent is mentioned

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add plugin/commands/summarise.md
git commit -m "refactor(commands): update summarise to use retrospective-writer agent"
```

---

## Task 7: Archive Old Documentation Agents

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugin/agents/doc-writer.md` (move to archive or delete)
- Modify: `plugin/agents/doc-reviewer.md` (move to archive or delete)

**Step 1: Create agents archive directory if needed**

```bash
mkdir -p plugin/agents/_archive
```

**Step 2: Move old agents to archive**

```bash
git mv plugin/agents/doc-writer.md plugin/agents/_archive/doc-writer.md
git mv plugin/agents/doc-reviewer.md plugin/agents/_archive/doc-reviewer.md
```

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "refactor(agents): archive old doc-writer and doc-reviewer agents"
```

---

## Task 8: Final Verification

**Files:**
- Verify: All new files created and old files archived
- Verify: Commands reference correct agents
- Verify: Agent structure matches template

**Step 1: Verify selecting-agents skill exists and is complete**

Check:
- `plugin/skills/selecting-agents/SKILL.md` exists
- Has valid frontmatter
- Contains all agent categories (documentation, debugging, development)
- Has common confusions section
- Has selection examples

**Step 2: Verify technical-writer agent structure**

- Different color from technical-writer (cyan vs pink)

**Step 4: Verify commands updated**

Check:
- `plugin/commands/doc-review.md` references `technical-writer` agent
- `plugin/commands/summarise.md` references `retrospective-writer` agent

**Step 5: Verify old agents archived**

Check:
- `plugin/agents/doc-writer.md` moved to `_archive/`
- `plugin/agents/doc-reviewer.md` moved to `_archive/`

**Step 6: Test agent discovery**

Run:
```bash
./plugin/tools/find-skills "selecting agents"
```
Expected: Should find the new selecting-agents skill

**Step 7: Final commit if any fixes needed**

If verification revealed issues and you fixed them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix(agents): address verification issues"
```
