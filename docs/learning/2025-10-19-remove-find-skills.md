# Remove Obsolete find-skills Discovery System

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Work Type:** Refactoring / Documentation Cleanup
**Implementation Plan:** `docs/plans/2025-10-19-remove-obsolete-find-skills.md`
**Code Location:** `plugin/` (deletions and documentation updates)

## What Was Accomplished

Removed the obsolete bash script-based skill discovery system (find-skills, using-skills) and updated all documentation to reflect Claude Code's native Skill tool auto-discovery. The migration involved strategic deletions, comprehensive documentation updates, and rigorous verification to ensure no orphaned references remained.

**Deliverables:**
- 3 files deleted (using-skills/SKILL.md, find-skills script, unified find tool)
- 8 documentation files updated (CLAUDE.md, README.md, plugin/skills/README.md, plugin/workflow/README.md, commit.md, session-start.sh, troubleshooting)
- 12 focused commits with conventional format
- 4 per-batch code review checkpoints + 1 final review
- 0 obsolete references remaining in plugin/

**Scope:**
- Removed bash-based skill discovery mechanism
- Kept find-practices tool (practices aren't auto-discovered yet)
- Updated all active documentation
- Preserved historical plan files (document past decisions)
- Fixed 7 blockers found across 5 code reviews

## Key Decisions (and Why)

### 1. **Keep find-practices, Remove find-skills**

**Why:** Claude Code's native Skill tool auto-discovers skills in `plugin/skills/` directories, making bash script discovery obsolete. However, practices are NOT skills - they're standards documents with YAML frontmatter. The find-practices script provides valuable discovery until Claude Code adds native practices support.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Remove both tools: Would lose practices discovery capability
- Keep both tools for consistency: Would maintain obsolete code

**Trade-offs:** Slight inconsistency (one discovery tool, not two) but maintains functionality where needed.

### 2. **Delete Unified find Tool (Not in Original Plan)**

**Why:** During Batch 4 code review, discovered the unified `plugin/tools/find` tool called the deleted `find-skills` script on line 85. This would cause silent failures when users ran `./plugin/tools/find "pattern"`. Since skills are now auto-discovered, the unified tool served no purpose.

**This was a critical catch:** The unified tool wasn't in the original 10-task plan. Code review prevented shipping broken functionality.

**Decision:** Delete the unified tool entirely, keep only find-practices.

### 3. **Update Historical Plan Files is Acceptable**

**Why:** During verification, questioned whether to update references in `docs/plans/` (historical documentation).

**Decision:** Leave historical files unchanged. They document past decisions and architecture at that point in time. Only update active documentation (README, CLAUDE.md, plugin/).

**Rationale:** Plans are time-stamped snapshots. Updating them would lose historical context about why bash scripts were created in the first place.

### 4. **Per-Batch Code Review Pattern**

**Why:** Implementing plan execution with code review checkpoints after each batch (Batch 1-3) plus final review.

**Results:** This pattern caught 7 issues that would have compounded:
- **Batch 1 review (4 blockers):** Orphaned references in workflow/README.md, session-start.sh, troubleshooting
- **Batch 2 review (1 blocker):** Incomplete CLAUDE.md update (Plugin Development section still referenced find-skills)
- **Final review (2 blockers):** Unified find tool calling deleted script, one remaining CLAUDE.md reference

**Value demonstrated:** Early detection prevented cascading documentation inconsistencies. Issues found in Batch 1 would have been harder to track down if discovered only at final review.

## What Didn't Work (and What We Learned)

### 1. **Incomplete Grep Verification in Original Plan**

**Problem:** Original plan Task 8 searched for `find-skills` references but didn't check for the unified `find` tool.

**Why it failed:** The unified tool was named `find` (not find-skills), so grep patterns missed it. Only code review of actual file contents caught it.

**Lesson:** Verification should include:
- Grep patterns for obvious names
- Manual review of remaining tool files
- Testing that tools still work after changes

**What worked:** The per-batch review pattern caught this before shipping.

### 2. **Path Consistency Questions During Implementation**

**Issue:** During documentation updates, multiple questions arose about `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolution and whether paths should be absolute or relative.

**Why this happened:** The original bash scripts handled path resolution differently than native Skill tool references.

**Resolution:** Clarified that:
- Skill tool uses auto-discovery (no paths needed)
- find-practices references use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}plugin/practices/`
- Direct practice references in agents use `@${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}plugin/practices/name.md`

**Lesson:** When changing discovery mechanisms, document path resolution patterns explicitly.

### 3. **Session Hook Reference Discovered Late**

**Problem:** Batch 1 code review found `plugin/hooks/session-start.sh` still referenced using-skills for context injection.

**Why it was missed:** Original plan Task 9 said "if it exists and references find-skills" but the hook referenced using-skills (different keyword).

**Fix:** Updated session-start.sh to remove the obsolete reference.

**Lesson:** Search for related terms (find-skills, using-skills, discovery, tools) not just the exact tool name.

## Issues Discovered (and How Solved)

### Issue 1: Orphaned References After File Deletion (3 blockers in Batch 1)

**What:** After deleting using-skills/SKILL.md and find-skills script, found 3 orphaned references:
- `plugin/workflow/README.md` referenced find-skills
- `plugin/hooks/session-start.sh` referenced using-skills
- `README.md` troubleshooting section referenced find-skills

**How solved:** Batch 1 code review caught all three. Fixed by:
- Updating workflow/README.md to explain native discovery
- Removing using-skills reference from session-start.sh
- Updating README troubleshooting for auto-discovery

**Prevention:** Comprehensive grep verification BEFORE deletion would have caught these.

### Issue 2: Unified find Tool Calling Deleted Script (2 blockers in final review)

**What:** `plugin/tools/find` on line 85 called `./tools/find-skills` which was deleted in Task 2.

**How solved:** Final code review caught this. Deleted the unified find tool entirely since skills are auto-discovered.

**Why it matters:** This would cause silent failures. Users running `./plugin/tools/find "pattern"` would get no results (script doesn't exist) with confusing error.

**Prevention:** Manual review of remaining tool files after deletions.

### Issue 3: Incomplete CLAUDE.md Update (1 blocker in Batch 2)

**What:** CLAUDE.md:306 in "Plugin Development" section still referenced find-skills as a discovery tool.

**How solved:** Batch 2 code review identified this. Updated line to reference native Skill tool.

**Why it happened:** Multiple sections of CLAUDE.md needed updates (Integration with Superpowers, Working with Skills, Plugin Development). Easy to miss one.

**Prevention:** Per-batch reviews caught this before proceeding to Batch 3.

## Time Estimates

**Original estimate:** 2-3 hours (primarily documentation updates)

**Actual time:** ~4 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Batch 1 (Deletions): 30 min + 45 min code review fixes = 1h 15min
- Batch 2 (Main docs): 45 min + 30 min code review fixes = 1h 15min
- Batch 3 (Final refs): 30 min + 15 min verification = 45 min
- Batch 4 (Final review): 30 min discovery + 15 min fixes = 45 min

**Why longer than expected:**
- Code reviews found 7 issues requiring fixes (not in original plan)
- Unified find tool deletion required additional investigation
- Path resolution questions needed clarification

**Was it worth it?** Absolutely. The extra hour caught 7 bugs that would have shipped broken discovery tools and inconsistent documentation.

## What Worked Well (Worth Repeating)

### 1. **Per-Batch Code Review Pattern**

**What:** After Batch 1, 2, 3 completion, triggered code review before proceeding to next batch. Plus final review after Task 10.

**Results:**
- Caught 7 issues early (4 in Batch 1, 1 in Batch 2, 2 in final)
- Issues found before they compounded into later batches
- Each batch started with clean state

**Why it worked:** Fresh review after each logical unit prevented errors from cascading. Finding 4 blockers in Batch 1 meant Batches 2-4 built on correct foundation.

**Repeat this:** Always use per-batch reviews for multi-batch plans, especially documentation migrations.

### 2. **Incremental Verification Pattern**

**What:** Fix → Verify → Commit cycle for each issue found in code reviews.

**Example from Batch 1:**
- Found orphaned reference in workflow/README.md
- Fixed the reference
- Ran grep to verify no other instances
- Committed fix with clear message: "Fixes 3 critical blockers found in Batch 1 code review"

**Why it worked:** Clear commit messages documenting what was fixed and why. Future readers can understand the code review → fix cycle.

**Repeat this:** Document blocker fixes in commit messages with reference to code review.

### 3. **Clear Conventional Commit Messages**

**What:** All 12 commits used conventional format with clear scope and rationale:
- `refactor: remove obsolete using-skills wrapper` (explained why obsolete)
- `fix: remove orphaned find-skills references from documentation` (identified as blocker)
- `docs: update CLAUDE.md for native skill discovery` (scope: CLAUDE.md)

**Why it worked:** Commit history tells a clear story:
1. Delete obsolete files (refactor)
2. Update documentation (docs)
3. Fix blockers found in review (fix)

**Repeat this:** Use conventional commits with context about WHY changes were made.

### 4. **Proactive Blocker Identification in Batch 1**

**What:** Batch 1 code review found 4 blockers immediately after deletions. Rather than continue to Batch 2, addressed all blockers first.

**Why it worked:** Clean foundation for remaining work. Batches 2-4 didn't encounter cascading failures from Batch 1 issues.

**Repeat this:** When code review finds blockers, fix them before proceeding to next batch.

### 5. **Comprehensive Grep Verification Commands**

**What:** Task 8 verification included:
- `grep -r "find-skills" plugin/ --include="*.md"`
- `grep -r "using-skills" plugin/ --include="*.md"`
- `grep -r "\./tools/find-skills" . --include="*.md" | grep -v "^docs/plans"`
- `ls -la plugin/tools/` (verify find-practices remains)

**Why it worked:** Multiple search patterns caught different reference styles. Excluding historical docs (`docs/plans`) made results actionable.

**Improvement needed:** Add manual review of tool files (would have caught unified find earlier).

## Native Claude Code Skills System Benefits

### Simplification Achieved

**Before (bash scripts):**
- Custom find-skills script searching both plugin locations
- using-skills wrapper providing tool paths
- Session hook injecting discovery instructions
- Documentation explaining bash script usage
- Users needed to know about `./plugin/tools/find-skills`

**After (native Skill tool):**
- Zero discovery scripts (auto-discovery)
- Zero path configuration (just skill names)
- Simple Skill tool invocation: `Skill(command: "cipherpowers:skill-name")`
- Documentation explains auto-discovery concept
- Users just reference skill names

**Reduction:** ~300 lines of bash scripts and documentation removed.

### Developer Experience Improvements

**Discovery friction removed:**
- Before: Users had to learn bash script paths and flags
- After: Skills automatically available, just reference by name

**Maintenance burden eliminated:**
- Before: Keep find-skills script in sync with both plugin locations
- After: Claude Code handles discovery automatically

**Error surface reduced:**
- Before: Bash script could fail (permissions, paths, shell differences)
- After: Native tool handles edge cases

### Why find-practices Remains Necessary

**Practices are NOT skills:**
- Skills: SKILL.md files with executable workflows
- Practices: Standards documents with YAML frontmatter

**Claude Code's Skill tool only discovers skills.** Practices need separate discovery mechanism until native support added.

**find-practices provides:**
- YAML frontmatter extraction (name, description, when_to_use)
- Search by pattern with --local and --upstream flags
- Same discovery UX as skills had

**When to remove:** When Claude Code adds native practices discovery (or practices get converted to different format).

## Open Questions / Follow-up

### 1. Should practices become a native Claude Code concept?

**Context:** We have a custom find-practices tool because practices (standards documents) aren't discovered like skills.

**Question:** Would it make sense to propose a native practices system to Claude Code team? Or are practices too project-specific?

**Follow-up:** Document practices use cases and patterns, evaluate whether upstream contribution makes sense.

### 2. Historical plan files - what's the long-term strategy?

**Context:** We decided to leave historical plan files (`docs/plans/`) unchanged even though they reference deleted tools.

**Question:** Will this confuse future readers who find references to tools that no longer exist?

**Options:**
- Add header to old plans: "Historical document - tools referenced may no longer exist"
- Create `docs/archived-plans/` for completed work
- Leave as-is (time-stamped files provide context)

**Recommendation:** Leave as-is for now. If confusion arises, add archive directory.

### 3. Marketplace practices discovery - test when available

**Context:** find-practices supports `${CIPHERPOWERS_MARKETPLACE_ROOT}` for upstream marketplace practices, but this isn't tested yet.

**Follow-up:** When marketplace is available, verify find-practices --upstream flag works correctly.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Per-batch code reviews catch cascading issues early.** 7 blockers found across 5 reviews prevented shipping broken documentation.

2. **Native Claude Code skills auto-discovery eliminates 300+ lines of bash scripts and documentation.** Massive simplification in developer experience.

3. **Comprehensive grep verification is necessary but not sufficient.** Manual review of affected files caught issues grep missed (unified find tool).

4. **Keeping find-practices was the right decision.** Practices aren't skills, need separate discovery until native support exists.

5. **Clear conventional commit messages tell the story.** Commit history shows refactor → docs → fix cycle clearly.

6. **Incremental verification (fix → verify → commit) creates traceable history.** Each blocker fix documented in commit message.

7. **Historical documentation should remain unchanged.** Time-stamped plans document past decisions, don't need updating.

## Success Metrics
